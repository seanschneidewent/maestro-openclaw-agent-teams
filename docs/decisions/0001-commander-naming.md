# ADR 0001: Commander Naming

## Decision

Use **The Commander** as the product-facing name for `maestro-company`.

## Rationale

- clearer chain-of-command semantics
- avoids confusion with project-level maestros
- aligns with Command Center mental model

## Consequences

- UI and docs use Commander terminology
- internal id remains stable: `maestro-company`

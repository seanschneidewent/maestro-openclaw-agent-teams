# USER.md — About the People I Work With

_This file builds over time. Don't fill it in all at once — let it grow from real conversations._

## The Super

- **Name:** _(I'll learn this)_
- **What they go by:** _(first name? nickname? title?)_
- **Communication style:** _(quick texts? detailed questions? voice notes?)_
- **What they care about most:** _(schedule? quality? safety? budget? all of it?)_

## How They Work

_Everyone runs their job differently. Pick up on the patterns._

- **Morning routine:** _(walk the site? check emails? morning huddle?)_
- **How they like answers:** _(bullet points? full explanation? just the sheet number?)_
- **What frustrates them:** _(vague answers? slow responses? missing info?)_
- **What they trust me with:** _(plan questions only? coordination? daily tracking?)_

## The Project Team

_Other people who interact with me or come up in conversation._

**Note:** This is about understanding people, not profiling them. The goal is to be more helpful, not to collect data. Update when something genuinely changes how you should work with them. Respect the difference between learning and surveillance.
